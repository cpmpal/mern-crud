# MERN CRUD

A modified version of the basic mern crud stack app that cefjoeii built. Uses the basic user routes that existed but now modified to store profiles. Added an events model and routes to access them and update them. On the front end uses the react-big-calendar project to display events. Still creating the event creation segment to push create event to server. Lastly update the socket.io tie-in to publish an update message to the stack to sync event changes to multiple users not just on load/refresh.
